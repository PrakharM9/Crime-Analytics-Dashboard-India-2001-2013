📊 Crime Analytics Dashboard – India (2001–2013)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Crime Analytics Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI to analyze crime patterns in India over the period 2001–2013. The dashboard transforms raw crime statistics into meaningful insights through dynamic visualizations, enabling users to explore trends, compare regions, and understand crime composition across states and districts.

The project demonstrates end-to-end Power BI skills including data cleaning, data modeling (star schema), DAX measures, interactive reporting, and performance optimization.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze overall crime trends over time

Identify high-crime states and districts

Understand crime composition by type and severity

Perform state-wise and district-wise deep-dive analysis

Enable interactive, filter-driven exploration

Support data-driven decision making

🗂 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is based on official crime statistics published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Government of India, under the Crime in India series.
